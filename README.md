# WebTrackerPOC

## Goals

- User associates a (potentially new) username with a browser-session (cookie)
- Requests to a particular address have the http-referer logged with the corrisponding username.

## Installation

A brand new ubuntu-style linux box is assued.

Some of the installation steps are very ram-hungry. On smaller servers I suggests using the instructions [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04) to give yourself extra swap space (try 4G).

This is all taken from a tutorial [here](https://github.com/Gabriel439/haskell-nix).  
Install Nix blindly, or figure out the proper secure way of doing it.
        curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
There will be a second step, which the output of the above should promt you for. something like:
        . /home/ubuntu/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
Next you to use nix to set up at some Haskell specific utilities.
        nix-env --install cabal2nix
        nix-env --install nix-prefetch-git
        nix-env --install cabal-install

Download and build the project
        git clone https://github.com/ShapeOfMatter/WebTrackerPOC.git
        cd WebTrackerPOC/
        cabal2nix . > default.nix
        nix-build unpinned.nix

You'll need a config file. For now it has to be named "defaults.config", and it shoudl go right in the WebTrackerPOC directory.
        [DatabaseConnectionPool]
        host = "example.com"
        port = 5432â†²
        user = "example"
        password = "xxx"
        database = "example"
        maxconnections = 5
        maxidleseconds = 60
        [SiteSettings]
        baseurl = http://example.com
        port = 80

Finally, you can set the server running just by calling:
       result/bin/poc_scotty_server
But remember to detach the process from your shell before loggin out.
